# VBA-Chalange.
Stock-market
use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
Create a new repository for this project called VBA-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
